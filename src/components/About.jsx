        <p className=" text-sm md:text-xl  mt-20">Hello! I'm a dedicated Computer Systems Engineering student with a strong passion for web development, particularly within the MERN stack. My journey into coding began with a fascination for how web applications are built, and it has blossomed into a commitment to creating dynamic, responsive user experiences. I specialize in MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js, and I enjoy leveraging these technologies to build full-stack applications.</p>

        <br />

        <p className=" text-sm md:text-xl mt-5 ">Through projects like a Coffee Website and a Netflix UI clone, I have gained hands-on experience in integrating APIs and managing application state using tools like Redux. I thrive on the challenge of turning complex problems into elegant solutions, and I'm constantly seeking to deepen my understanding of modern web development practices. In addition to my technical skills, I enjoy playing sports like football and cricket, which help me maintain a balanced lifestyle. I'm excited to connect with others in the tech community and share insights on building impactful web applications!</p>
